# Security Implementation

## Client-Side Security Measures

1. **Form Validation**

   - Client-side validation to prevent malformed data submission
   - Required field validation
   - Email format validation
   - Phone number pattern matching
   - File type restrictions for uploads

2. **Input Sanitization**

   - All user inputs are treated as untrusted
   - HTML special characters are automatically escaped by browser DOM APIs

3. **File Upload Restrictions**

   - Image uploads restricted to image/\* MIME types
   - Transcript restricted to PDF files

4. **Secure Dependencies**
   - All external libraries loaded via HTTPS from trusted CDNs
   - Bootstrap v5.3.0 (latest stable version)

## Recommended Server-Side Security (Not Implemented)

For a production environment, you would need to implement:

1. **Server-Side Validation**

   - Re-validate all inputs on server
   - More rigorous file type verification

2. **CSRF Protection**

   - Implement anti-CSRF tokens

3. **HTTPS Enforcement**

   - Serve all content over HTTPS

4. **Database Security**

   - Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
   - Proper password hashing if authentication added

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent brute force attacks on forms

## Security Headers (For Production)

These HTTP headers should be added in production:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Strict-Transport-Security
